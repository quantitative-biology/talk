## Building quantitative skills for biologists
1. Why worry about quantitative skills?
2. Quantitative self-confidence and skill aquisition
3. Normalizing failure to build self confidence
4. Getting the training you need with limited time

## What are quantitative skills?
- Math
- Stats
- Computation

- Open science & collaboration

## Math
- creating predictive models based on our knowledge of biology
<br>
(e.g., modelling disease dynamics)
  
```{r, out.width = "60%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("disease.jpeg")
```

## Stats
- handling complicated statistical analyses<br>
(e.g., looking at climate change impacts)

```{r, out.width = "70%",fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41558-018-0067-3/MediaObjects/41558_2018_67_Fig1_HTML.jpg")
```

Cohen et al. (2018) used a trivariate meta-analysis across 1,011 time series to determine that phenology occurred earlier through time as temperature increased

## Computation
- using algorithms to assess big data <br>
(e.g., harnassing genetic data to inform medical issues)
```{r, out.width = "70%",fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure/image?size=large&download=&id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006258.g002")

## Open Science

- providing data, source code and dynamic documents to make work completely reproducible 
- Note this document and figures provided at https:/github.com/quantitative-biology/talk

## Apparent Problem: Lack of training
1. New scientists with an interest in biology often self-select away from training in mathematics, statistics and computing
2. Training may not be required by their programs <br>
(e.g., only 1⁄4 of ecology PhD programs in the US even require a statistics course)
```{r, out.width = "40%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1368299e-2ffb-454f-9bee-4178064950bf/ecs21394-fig-0004-m.png")
```

## Is this really a problem?

- Most biology undergraduates are required to take an introductory calculus, statistics, or computational literacy class, 
- <b><span style="color:red">BUT</span></b> the relationship between these quantitative techniques and biological concepts may not be obvious (Eaton and Highlander 2017)
- <b><span style="color:red">AND</span></b> in spite of recommendations (National Research Council et al 2003), biology courses usually have little quantitative material 
- <b><span style="color:red">FINALLY</span></b> in many cases institutions or departments lack faculty expertise in the relevant areas (Williams et al. 2019)

## That is, during the training of undergraduate biologists we lie about the need for quantitative methods <br> (by omission of course...)

And this is a problem because:

- New scientists in biology may not even know they don't have the training they need, or
- if they have such training they may not connect it to doing biological research, or
- if they realize that they need training, they may not be able to find opportunties at their institution

<b><span style="color:red">BUT</span></b> even if they have the opportunity, they may lack the self-confidence to take full advantage of it<br>

# Quantitative self-confidence
## Quantitative self-confidence
- belief in one’s ability to perform particular tasks in a given setting (Bandura 1997)
- math self-confidence had a stronger positive impact on mathematics problem-solving than prior experience (Pajares and Miller 1994)
- individuals that underestimate their ability to perform quantitative tasks may develop learning aversion or anxiety (Chen Musgrove and Schussler 2020)

## New scientists in biological research may lack quantitative self-confidence

New scientists may:

- have originally selected biology as undergrads because it was "less quantitative" 
- not have had opportunities to practice quantitative skills in their undergrad program
- believe they cannot develop these skills, or that it will be very difficult/uncomfortable/soul-destroying
<br>

<span style="color:red">$\rightarrow$</span> Consequently, may self-select away from learning these skills

## Self-confidence and equity-seeking groups
- quantitative skills are often tied to stereotypes related to gender and race
- can create a difficult barrier even for otherwise confident students (Flanagan and Einarson 2017)
- self-confidence of African-American PhDs in computing and mathematics was
strongly affected by interactions with peers, verbal encouragement, and a social community (Charleston and Leon 2016)

```{r, out.width = "60%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/how_it_works.png")
```
<font size="2"><div align="center">https://xkcd.com/385/ </div></font>

## Two stages at which quantitative self-confidence is critical
1. self-selection for training opportunities
2. using quantitative skills in research

```{r, out.width = "65%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("Main_concept_v3.png")
```

# To improve self-confidence, normalize failure
## It's time to stop hiding failure, and start building self-confidence

- science publications hide all the failure that preceeded success
- new scientists may not realize that several quantitative analyses were tried and failed, were implemented improperly and redone, or failed to answer the research question and were abandoned 

- even sophisticated quantitative methods developed by distinguished researchers might fail on a particular problem

- new scientists need the confidence to recognize when the method or its implementation is at fault, rather than engaging in self-criticism when a particular approach doesn’t work. 

## Failing to solve a problem is part of the research and learning process, not a commentary on self-identity

- many graduate students enter graduate school with very little experience in academic failure (Ward-Penny et al. 2011)
- learning quantitative methods requires students to engage with problems and fail to solve them at first
- it is essential that early failures do not undermine confidence so much that efforts to learn are abandoned

## Normalize failure to build self-confidence

Some techniques can help develop a resilience to failure, by building recognition that it is a normal part of acquiring new skills

<font size="4"><div style="float: left; width: 55%">
- have students experience the need for knowledge in new areas by failing to solve a problem with known methods</font>
- <font size="4">normalize failure by ensuring students observe it in instructors (e.g., write code live in class, Johnston et al. 2019)</font>
- <font size="4">have instructors and peers talk about statistics or mathematics anxiety</font>
- <font size="4">be careful when assigning group work, because students with less experience need to do more quantitative work, not less, than experienced peers</font>

</div></font>

<div style="float: right; width: 45%;">

```{r, out.width = "100%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("Rcurve.jpg")
```
</div>

## Positive feedback loop for skill acquisition and application
Overcoming self-confidence barriers by normalizing failure can initiate a positive reinforcing loop

- Lack of self-confidence can serve as a barrier between each stage (cross-hatching), but 
- if students persevere to the application stage, they are more likely to begin the process again, and 
- would likely face reduced roadblocks from lack of self-confidence

```{r, out.width = "90%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("feedback.png")
```

# Training vs Time
## I'm feeling confident! How do I learn to do all this stuff??
- there's way too much stuff!!
- you will not be able to do it all, collaborate!
- combine short-term and informal learning with "classic" course work

```{r, out.width = "90%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("quantskills_trainingv2.png")
```

## Our approach: Self-directed and extremely short modules
- designed as a "quick-start"
- 3-5 hours
- very basic overviews
- pointers to more advanced materials
- very practical... make sure the student can <span style="color:red">DO</span> something by the end

```{r, out.width = "60%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("Frontpage.png")
```
<font size="2"><div align="center">https://quantitative-biology.ca </div></font>

## Our approach: Written by biologists for biologists
- techniques chosen are those we find most helpful
- illustrate how we use these skills as researchers (in a simplified way)
- audience is graduate students and professionals in biological research

## Our approach: Failure up front
- live coding <span style="color:red">$\rightarrow$<span> with naturally occuring screwups to normalize failure
- we EXPECT there to be errors (all authors are human, even Brian?), and we will treat this is as a live document

```{r, out.width = "60%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("Livecoding.png")
```
<font size="2"><div align="center">https://www.quantitative-biology.ca/git-and-github.html#using-git-and-github-to-collaborate-with-colleagues </div></font>

## Our approach: Include code and demos
- R for coding, since it is the most frequently used
- provide worked examples to get folks up and running

```{r, out.width = "60%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("Codeforquickstart.png")
```
<font size="2"><div align="center">https://www.quantitative-biology.ca/machine-learning-and-classification.html#our-first-ann </div></font>

## Our approach: Some exercises with worked answers 

- so you can build confidence by working independently
- right now: answer keys at the end of chapters
- might move to a more interactive approach (with shiny and learnr)

```{r, out.width = "60%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("Exercise.png")
```
<font size="2"><div align="center">https://www.quantitative-biology.ca/machine-learning-and-classification.html#answer-key-1 </div></font>

## My thoughts for modifications 
- personally really enjoyed having a MOOC community (when these were still mostly free)
- need to build a <span style="color:red">community of practice</span> where comments can be made (could use hypothes.is?, looking for bullet proof stability)

- right now: could use github issues
```{r, out.width = "60%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("githubissues.png")
```

<font size="2"><div align="center">https://github.com/quantitative-biology/Basics/issues </div></font>

## Future plans
- want to add a chapter on regression and machine learning
- time series? spatial stuff? 
- (personally can't stand ArcGIS...)

```{r, out.width = "60%", fig.align = 'center'}
